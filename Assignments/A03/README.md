### 10060 - A man in a hole
## Assignment 3 - Problem Solving Presentation

## Overview
Using the cp3 book, got the algorithm for area and struct point. 

Use the formula: 
sum of volumes of individual sheets/(pi * (radius of the manhole)^2 * thickness of the manhole)

Language: c++ 

Data structures: 

Vector of points to store the points that made the sheets. There was no manipulation needed to the points just needed to store the points to find the area. 

Speed did not factor into the previous choices. Simply found the pattern.
