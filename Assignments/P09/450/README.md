## 450 - Little Black Book
### Arshia Clare

### Description:
The Public Relations Office is looking for an easier way to compile the information for their Black Book,
a listing of all faculty members. Currently, each department types up a list of their faculty and submits
the list to PR. PR then takes all the lists and makes a combined list that is sorted alphabetically by
last name. So far they have been doing this task by hand, which takes far more time than the average
PR employee has to spare!
What PR is looking for is a program that will take these faculty listings and combine them in a
certain format that PR can use for inclusion in the Black Book. All the lists are stored in text files.
Each departmentâ€™s file is sorted by last name. The program should take these individually sorted files
and combine them into a single sorted file in the format shown below.
