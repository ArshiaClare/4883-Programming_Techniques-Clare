## 12347 - Binary Search Tree
### Arshia Clare
### Decription:
A binary search tree is a binary tree that satisfies the following properties:
• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
• Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Pre-order traversal (Root-Left-Right) prints out the nodes key by visiting the root node then traversing the left subtree and then traversing the right subtree. Post-order traversal (Left Right-Root) prints
out the left subtree first and then right subtree and finally the root node. For example, the results of
pre-order traversal and post-order traversal of the binary tree shown in Figure 1 are as follows:
Pre-order: 50 30 24 5 28 45 98 52 60
Post-order: 5 28 24 45 30 60 52 98 50
Given the pre-order traversal of a binary search tree, you task is to find the post-order traversal of
this tree.
