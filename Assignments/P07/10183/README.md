## 10183 - How Many Fibs?
### Arshia Clare

### Description:
Recall the definition of the Fibonacci numbers:
f1 := 1
f2 := 2
fn := fn−1 + fn−2 (n ≥ 3)
Given two numbers a and b, calculate how many Fibonacci numbers are in the range [a, b].

Problem with completing the program was the size of the values, I did an unsigned long long int to try to solve the problem.
